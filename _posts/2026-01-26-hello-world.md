This is my new blog. I'll be updating it every now and then. Here's an interesting code snippet I looked at today[^1]:

```py
with context_keys(a="Hello", b="world"):
    logger.info("This has context")
logger.info("This does not")
```

And here's the last tech (adjacent) talk I watched:

{% include video id="FbV9EFHnGOE" provider="youtube" %}

{: .notice--info}
One thing I like to mention on these posts is that I'm a nerd.
