I saw this on HN this morning. Nearly 30 years ago Swatch created [Swatch
Internet time](https://beats.wiki). It's called .Beats time, and it's a decimal
timekeeping system (1000 `.Beats` per day) based apparently on the solar day.

Wikipedia says it's calculated from UTC+1, and there's no representation of the
date, just the .beats, but it's probably the Gregorian calendar in Biel. It
seems like UTC with a different hat.

Strictly speaking, the second in Swatch time is based on the definition of a
day, but since it's defined in terms of UTC, it must be a translation of SI
seconds..?

Anyway, all the finery aside, Swatch time abolishes timezones and daylight
savings time so that referring to time can be more natural. If it's 584 .beats
where I am, it's the same time all over the world. Is that... helpful? Someone
on HN mentioned this post, [So You Want to Abolish
Timezones](https://qntm.org/abolish). If you read that and still think .beats
are a good idea, I'll be stunned.

I've talked [before]({% post_url 2026-02-06-ntpsec %}) about time coordination
and how the definition of "the time" is sociotechnical, with an emphasis on
_socio_. If there's any problem with timezones it's that there aren't enough of
them. The original timezone scheme in the US had 144 timezones.

Sure, it's hard to agree on when to have a meeting, but that's only because
globalization is hard. You need to have either social empathy for how people
organize their lives in other places or a dictum that everyone change their idea
of the day from something natural to something arbitrary, like the natural time
in some place I've never been to.

So be happy that the world has such diversity! And refer back to your timezone
tables. Because timekeeping will always be as complicated as the places and
people that keep the time.
