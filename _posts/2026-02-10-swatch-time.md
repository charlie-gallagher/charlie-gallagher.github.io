I saw this on HN this morning. Nearly 30 years ago Swatch created [Swatch
Internet time](https://beats.wiki). The units are called .beats, and they're a
decimal timekeeping system (1000 .beats per day) based apparently on the solar
day in Biel, Switzerland. The second in this new timescale is defined as 1/1000
of a day, but since it seems to be defined in terms of UTC, it's probably a
translation of SI seconds..?

It seems like UTC with a different hat.

All the finery aside, Swatch time abolishes timezones and daylight savings time
so that referring to time can be more natural. If it's 584 .beats where I am,
it's the same time all over the world. This is supposed to be refreshing for
people who spend a lot of time trying to coordinate people in different
timezones. Someone on HN mentioned this post, [So You Want to Abolish
Timezones](https://qntm.org/abolish). If you read that and still think .beats
are a good idea, I'll be stunned.

I've talked [before]({% post_url 2026-02-06-ntpsec %}) about time coordination
and how the definition of "the time" is sociotechnical, with an emphasis on
_socio_. If there's any problem with timezones it's that there aren't enough of
them. The original timezone scheme in the US had [144
timezones](https://www.bts.gov/explore-topics-and-geography/geography/geospatial-portal/history-time-zones-and-daylight-saving).

Sure, it's hard to agree on when to have a meeting, but that's only because
globalization is hard. You need to have either social empathy for how people
organize their lives in other places or a dictum that everyone change their idea
of the day from something natural to something arbitrary, like the natural time
in some place I've never been to.

So be happy that the world has such diversity! And refer back to your timezone
tables. Because timekeeping is as complicated as the places and people that keep
the time.
