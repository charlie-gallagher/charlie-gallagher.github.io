          of about 232 picoseconds. In practice, this limit is unattainable due
to quantum limits on the clock speed of ballistic-electron logic."

Types:

- Change how I look at something
- Change how I do something
- Links and materials
- You did what??
- You did something I've always wanted to do but never knew how
- Personal challenge
- It's easier than you think, and pretty fun (think Prog. Pearls profilers)
- Right a misunderstanding, a wrong
- Tell a good story
- Dig deeper than usual
- The programming pearls pattern: relate it to life, dive in, distill principles

Anti types:

- How I feel about something
- Rehash someone else's work (connect it!)
- Vague guide to some technique like TDD (make it concrete!)
- Advice (if it sounds like it works for me, others will take it as advice if
  it's relevant to them; don't alienate by being preachy)
