My name's Charlie, and I'm a software developer from Philadelphia, PA. I work at [IXIS Digital](https://www.ixisdigital.com) as a data analytics engineer, but my interests are broadly in low-level systems and performance, API design, and distributed systems.

If you'd like to get in contact with me, reach me at charlie@ixisdigital.com.
